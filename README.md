Why are we doing this?
This is a test of what we have learned over the last 2 months whilst on this journey.  It is a chance to showcase what we are good at and to find any development needs we may have.

How I expected the challenge to go.
I expect that I will do well at some aspects of the challenge and struggle with some others.  The thing I think I will have most trouble with is fetch APIs and DOM manipulation as we have only just learned these aspects of javascript.  I also may struggle with the time constraint as I have come away from home to spend a long weekend with my family who are currently on holiday in the Highlands and I have poor wifi and have not brought my notes with me! 

What went well?
I managed to get the service built quite quickly.
I set up an SQL database using the service which worked.
I designed a basic home page for the front end with links to the CRUD functionality.
I built the forms which would be used to collect data and send to the database.

What didn't go as planned?
I struggled to get GitHub to connect to Eclipse.
It took me all weekend to figure out how to not get a CORS error when trying to send data through a fetch function.
I still cannot work out how to get the forms to write to the database using a fetch function, although I can write set data to the database through the 'create' tab.  Most of the resources online use a .php file which we have not been taught and it would have been wrong to just copy this from a video just to get it to work.
I have completed only manual testing of the project.  Ran JUnit which has a 5.6% coverage as no time to design tests.
All the javascript and css functions are hard coded into the HTML page as I ran out of time to move them.
Could have committed items to GitHub more regularly - even if they did not work!

Possible improvements for future revisions of the project.
Design more stringent tests for the project.
Move javascript and css functions from the HTML pages and place in seperate files.
Get the functionality to work between the front end and the back end.
